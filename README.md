# ratscape
This is a Satire Runescape clone me and a friend started as a final project in our Highschool Progamming class. 
The original project was made in Visual Basic but I thought it would be a neat idea to port it over and implement
more ideas into Python and the PyGame module.

'start.py' is the original file from 3 years ago
'ratscape.py' is the one I am currently working on.

(im not good with GitHub, so I don't know how to delete it)
